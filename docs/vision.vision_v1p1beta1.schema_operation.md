## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [done](./vision.vision_v1p1beta1.schema_operation.done.md) | boolean \| null | If the value is <code>false</code>, it means the operation is still in progress. If <code>true</code>, the operation is completed, and either <code>error</code> or <code>response</code> is available. |
|  [error](./vision.vision_v1p1beta1.schema_operation.error.md) | [Schema$Status](./vision.vision_v1p1beta1.schema_status.md) | The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation. |
|  [metadata](./vision.vision_v1p1beta1.schema_operation.metadata.md) | { \[key: string\]: any; } \| null | Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. |
|  [name](./vision.vision_v1p1beta1.schema_operation.name.md) | string \| null | The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the <code>name</code> should be a resource name ending with <code>operations/{unique_id\}</code>. |
|  [response](./vision.vision_v1p1beta1.schema_operation.response.md) | { \[key: string\]: any; } \| null | The normal response of the operation in case of success. If the original method returns no data on success, such as <code>Delete</code>, the response is <code>google.protobuf.Empty</code>. If the original method is standard <code>Get</code>/<code>Create</code>/<code>Update</code>, the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type <code>XxxResponse</code>, where <code>Xxx</code> is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is <code>TakeSnapshot()</code>, the inferred response type is <code>TakeSnapshotResponse</code>. |
