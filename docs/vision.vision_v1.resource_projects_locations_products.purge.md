## vision\_v1.Resource$Projects$Locations$Products.purge() method

Asynchronous API to delete all Products in a ProductSet or all Products that are in no ProductSet.

If a Product is a member of the specified ProductSet in addition to other ProductSets, the Product will still be deleted.

It is recommended to not delete the specified ProductSet until after this operation has completed. It is also recommended to not add any of the Products involved in the batch delete to a new ProductSet while this operation is running because those Products may still end up deleted.

It's not possible to undo the PurgeProducts operation. Therefore, it is recommended to keep the csv files used in ImportProductSets (if that was how you originally built the Product Set) before starting PurgeProducts, in case you need to re-import the data after deletion.

If the plan is to purge all of the Products from a ProductSet and then re-use the empty ProductSet to re-import new Products into the empty ProductSet, you must wait until the PurgeProducts operation has finished for that ProductSet.

The google.longrunning.Operation API can be used to keep track of the progress and results of the request. `Operation.metadata` contains `BatchOperationMetadata`<!-- -->. (progress)

## Example


```js
// Before running the sample:
// - Enable the API at:
//   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/vision.googleapis.com
// - Login into gcloud by running:
//   `$ gcloud auth application-default login`
// - Install the npm module by running:
//   `$ npm install googleapis`

const {google} = require('googleapis');
const vision = google.vision('v1');

async function main() {
  const auth = new google.auth.GoogleAuth({
    // Scopes can be specified either as an array or as a single, space-delimited string.
    scopes: [
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform',
      'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-vision',
    ],
  });

  // Acquire an auth client, and bind it to all future calls
  const authClient = await auth.getClient();
  google.options('auth', authClient);

  // Do the magic
  const res = await vision.projects.locations.products.purge({
    // Required. The project and location in which the Products should be deleted.
    //
    // Format is `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOC_ID`.
    parent: 'projects/my-project/locations/my-location',

    // Request body metadata
    requestBody: {
      // request body parameters
      // {
      //   "deleteOrphanProducts": false,
      //   "force": false,
      //   "productSetPurgeConfig": {}
      // }
    },
  });
  console.log(res.data);

  // Example response
  // {
  //   "done": false,
  //   "error": {},
  //   "metadata": {},
  //   "name": "my_name",
  //   "response": {}

main().catch(e => {
  console.error(e);
  throw e;
});
