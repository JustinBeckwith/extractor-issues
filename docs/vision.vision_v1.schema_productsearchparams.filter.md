## vision\_v1.Schema$ProductSearchParams.filter property

The filtering expression. This can be used to restrict search results based on Product labels. We currently support an AND of OR of key-value expressions, where each expression within an OR must have the same key. An '=' should be used to connect the key and value.

For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND brand = Google" is acceptable, but "(color = red OR brand = Google)" is not acceptable. "color: red" is not acceptable because it uses a ':' instead of an '='.

```typescript
